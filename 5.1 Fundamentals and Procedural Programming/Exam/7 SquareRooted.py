num = 4

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write some code that calculates the square and the square root
#of the number given above. Then, it should print the root the
#square number of times. If the square root is a decimal,
#round it down (you can do this by converting the decimal to
#an integer: Python will automatically round it down).
#
#For example, if num is 4, then your code would print:
#
# 2222222222222222
#
#That's 2 16 times. 4 squared is 16, the square root of 4 is 2,
#and so it prints 2 16 times.
#
#For another example: if num is 13, then 13 squared is 169, and
#the square root of 13 is ~3.6. 3.6 rounds down to 3. So, it would
#print 3 169 times.


#Add your code here!
import math
print(num*num*str(int(math.sqrt(num))))
