#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#mystery_string_1 and mystery_string_2 are each strings
#representing numbers. Write some code below that will find
#the numeric sum of the numbers represented by these strings.
#For example, if the strings were "17" and "9", your answer
#would be 26.
#
#Then, print out the result as part of a sentence of this
#form: "The sum of the two strings is 26". (Do not include
#quotes in your output, only print the message inside the
#quotes.)
#
#You may assume that both strings will hold integers.


#Add your code here!
print("The sum of the two strings is {0}".format(int(mystery_string_1)+int(mystery_string_2)))
