#Write your function here!
#This one is a challenge. There's a lot going on: splitting
#up strings, removing unnecessary characters, converting to
#integers, and running a big conditional. Our solution to
#this is 34 lines -- you can do it!
#
#In web development, it is common to represent a color like 
#this:
#
#  rgb(red_val, green_val, blue_val)
#
#where red_val, green_val and blue_val would be substituted 
#with values from 0-255 telling the computer how much to 
#light up that portion of the pixel. For example:
#
# - rgb(255, 0, 0) would make a color red. 
# - rgb(255, 255, 0) would make yellow, because it is equal 
#   parts red and green. 
# - rgb(0, 0, 0) would make black, the absence of all color.
# - rgb(255, 255, 255) would make white, the presence of all
#   colors equally.
#
#Don't let the function-like syntax here confuse you: here,
#these are just strings. The string "rgb(0, 255, 0)"
#represents the color green.
#
#Write a function called "find_color" that accepts a single 
#argument expected to be a string as just described. Your
#function should return a simplified version of the color
#that is represented according to the following rules:
#
# If there is more red than any other color, return "red".
# If there is more green than any other color, return "green".
# If there is more blue than any other color, return "blue".
# If there are equal parts red and green, return "yellow".
# If there are equal parts red and blue, return "purple".
# If there are equal parts green and blue, return "teal".
# If there are equal parts red, green, and blue, return "gray".
# (even though this might be white or black).

    red,green,blue =int(k4[0]),int(k4[1]),int(k4[2])
    if red >green and red>blue :
        return "red"
    if red <green and green>blue :

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.

#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: red, purple, gray, each on their own line.
